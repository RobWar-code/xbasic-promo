All Pass criteria must be achieved for a pass to be awarded.

It is expected that project work submitted for this unit will demonstrate the same knowledge and skills shown in 
HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python Essentials modules across the grading levels. The learner demonstrates characteristics 
of higher-level performance as described below.


Merit Performance

To evidence performance at the MERIT level, a learner will, in general, demonstrate characteristics of performance 
at the MERIT level, as suggested below. However, the learner must achieve ALL listed merit criteria.

The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, 
well-documented, relational database-backed, Full-Stack application for a real-life audience, with a complete 
set of CRUD creation, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features. Data validation, API handling 
and user feedback are all evident in the code and the working application. Templates are used to produce working 
features correctly. There are no logic errors in the code, and the application functions as expected.

The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target 
audience (or multiple related audiences) and a particular data domain. Its purpose would be immediately 
evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation. The user is kept informed of progress 
and actions through feedback and, where large data sets are being loaded, progress indicators.

The web application design follows the principles of UX design and accessibility guidelines, and the site is 
fully responsive.

Data is fully modelled and matches the schema. The schema design is documented in the README. Datastore 
configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed easily. Configuration and settings files 
are well-organised, and there are different versions for different branches.

1.1 	Design a Front-End for a Full-Stack application following UX design principles, which meets 
        accessibility guidelines, is easy to navigate and allows the user to find information and resources intuitively.
1.2 	Create templates, writing code that demonstrates a solid understanding of template syntax, logic and usage
1.3 	Provide evidence of refining Epics to User Stories to Tasks
1.4 	Clear user acceptance criteria have been defined.
1.5 	Should-have prioritised user stories should not be more than 60% of the timebox user story points total.
2.1 	Design a Full-Stack application that lets the user initiate and control actions and gives immediate 
        and complete feedback on data processes
2.2 	Write robust code that is free of errors in all parts of the application.
2.3 	Implement a Full-Stack application whose purpose is quickly evident to a new user.

        well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences), 
        explaining the data, and explaining the security features considered
4.1 	Fully document the results of well-planned automated testing procedures to assess the website’s functionality, 
        usability and responsiveness. Include an evaluation of bugs found and their fixes and explanation of any 
        bugs that are left unfixed
5.1 	Describe the data schema fully in the README file
5.2 	Commit often for each feature/fix, ensuring that commits are small, well-defined and have clear, 
        descriptive messages
6.1 	Fully document the deployment procedure in a section in a README file, written using consistent and
        effective markdown formatting that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.
7.1 	Implement efficient model code in the solution

All Merit criteria must be achieved for merit to be awarded.
Distinction Performance

At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, as described above, and will demonstrate 
characteristics of high-level performance as described below:

Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION level:

The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application. The development of the project 
has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive web application.

The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user 
interface and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no logic errors in the code. Where there is a 
clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, 
appropriate and acceptable to the target user. It matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of 
craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered 
in the unit

Amplification (craftsmanship)

Front-End Design

The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:

Information Hierarchy

    semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an 
    organised fashion with each piece of information being easy to find

    all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion with each piece of information being 
    easy to find

    all resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively
    information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority

    User Control
        all interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional response within the user. 
        This is down to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures 
        and all interaction feedback

        when displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio; 
        instead letting the user initiate and control such actions

        users who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page without having to 
        use the browser navigation buttons

        users are never asked for information that the application already has (e.g. a contact form does not 
        ask a logged in user for an email address).

        the user is shown progress indicators and feedback on transactions.
        errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to the user

        Consistency
            evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design
            consistency across all data operations, including in the reporting

            Confirmation
                user and data actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times

                Accessibility
                    there is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity

Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience design principles are
 identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in the README)

Development and Implementation

Code demonstrates characteristics of ‘clean code’

Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming, e.g.

    file names, class names, function names and variable names are descriptive and consistent
    for cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only
    all HTML attributes, CSS rules, code variables and function names are consistent in format, follow standards for 
    the language and are appropriate and meaningful

    app urls are consistent

    File structure
        whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain 
        all static files and code may be organised into sub-directories such as css, js, etc)

        there is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all
        inside a directory named 'libraries')

        files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for 
        cross-platform compatibility.

        Readability
            code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability and there are no unnecessary repeated 
            blank lines (and never more than 2)

            id/class(CSS and JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose

            all code is split into well-defined and commented sections

            Semantic markup is used to structure HTML code

            HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python are kept in separate, linked files

            CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element

            non-trivial Javascript code files are linked to at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of 
            the head element if needs loaded before the body HTML)

            Defensive design
                all input data is validated (e.g. presence check, format check, range check)
                internal errors are handled gracefully and users are notified of the problem where appropriate

                Comments
                    all custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of code segments

                    Compliant code
                        HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
                        CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
                        JavaScript code passes through a linter (e.g. jslint.com) with no major issues
                        Python code is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's)

                        Robust code
                            no logic errors are found when running code
                            errors caused by user actions are handled
                            where used, API calls that fail to execute or return data will be handled gracefully, 
                                with the site users notified in an obvious way
                            inputs are validated when necessary
                            navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never break the site, 
                                there are no broken links
                            user actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console

The entire design is implemented, providing an excellent solution to the users' demands and expectations and 
security consideration.

Real-world application

    Understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.
    All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
    The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the project

Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have been followed. All noticeable 
errors have been corrected or documented:

Security features and practice are evidenced

    passwords and secret keys are stored in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore and are 
    never committed to the repository

    any functionality requiring log-in is available only to logged-in users
    user permissions and levels of access are appropriate

Framework conventions are followed and used correctly. Including the following:

Django:

    Templates
    Apps
    Models
    Views
    Placing logic in the most relevant components demonstrates an understanding of the Model-View-Controller(Template) pattern is evident through the placing of logic in the most appropriate components.
    Configuration and settings files are well-organised

Security features and practice are evidenced.

    passwords and secret keys are stored in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore and are 
    never committed to the repositoryn any functionality requiring log-in is available only to logged-in users
    user permissions and levels of access are appropriate

Data is well structured.

    Data is fully modelled and matches the schema.
    Datastore configuration is kept in a single location where it can be changed easily.
    data is well-structured, organised into logical entities with clear relationships between them
    all CRUD functionality is present and working, and actions are immediately reflected in the

    Front-End
        any data used across multiple apps is shared and not duplicated.

Configuration and dependencies files are kept up to date. Separate versions/branches of these are commits 
where relevant. Datastore configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed easily. 
The datastore is not accessible to the regular user without going through the code.

Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have clearly been followed. 
There is clear evidence of testing and this is demonstrated in git commits. All noticeable errors have 
been corrected or documented:

    navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never break the site, there are no broken links
    user actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console

README

Recommended structure for a README.md file:


As a mandatory part of the submission, your project must have a readme file named README.md, in markdown format, 
that will describe all aspects of your project.

The link below provides an official example of an expected structure for your readme file

Example README.md template

NOTE:

While it is a requirement for your README to be in English, we also strongly recommend that your site is in 
English too. The assessment will be conducted in English so to ensure that the functionality and navigation 
can be fully assessed, we recommend that the site is in English. If the site is in a language other than English, 
at a very minimum you should ensure you have correctly set the lang attribute in the HTML to the character code 
of the web apps content language. This will allow the browser to attempt a translation into English.
