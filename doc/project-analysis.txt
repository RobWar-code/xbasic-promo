## Project Aims

	To provide an introduction and support system for potential and
	existing users of the XBasic programming language.

	To meet the requirements of the CI Full Stack Development Diploma
	Project 4. See: project-requirements.txt

## Users and Requirements

	It is anticpated that the site would be visited by the following
	types of user:

		People with Windows or Linux systems that are new to 
		programming who are looking for a programming
		language that is fully-featured but easy to learn.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a rapid development
		system for interactive and command-line utilities that can 
		run on Linux and Windows with easy debugging features.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a straight-forward
		way to build standalone GUI applications for Linux and/or
		Windows.

		Existing XBasic users who need additional look-up facilities
		and a forum for discussing problems and reporting errors.

		Some users may be using a mobile phone or tablet to quickly
		reference programming languages

### User Stories and Requirements

	New Programmers:
	"I need to know how easy it is to learn to use this system"

		The opening page should have a brief description of the XBasic
		system.

		There should be screenshots of the PDE, toolbox in operation

		A screenshot example of some code which has been run

		A screenshot example of an error message

	"I need documentation/training material"

		Link to the XBasic manual

	"I need some code examples"

		Reference to the code examples provided with the download

	"I need to know how to obtain and set-up this system"

		Links to the sourceforge and github sites

	"I need to talk to users"

		Links to the groups.io and sourceforge sites

	Utility Programmers:
	The needs are as for new programmers but add:

	"I need file processing capabilities"

		File handling capabilities description

		Database handling capabilities description

	"I sometimes need a GUI interface"

		GUI toolkit description and screenshots 

	"I need to be able to discuss problems and issues sometimes"

		Error and problem discussion page/Database

	Standalone program GUI Developer:
	As above but add:

	"I need an efficient way to develop GUI applications"

		As above, but quite detailed discussion of GUI features

	Existing Users:

	"I may need access to the documentation"

		Link to manual

	"I would like easy access to problem solving"

		Problem reporting page


	Mobile Phone User:

		As above but allow for the fact that screenshot images may not
		be easily legible, so compensate in the texts.

### Summary of Features to meet Requirements

	General Description
	Introduction to PDE
	Introduction to GUI toolkit
	Introduction to Language Features
	Introduction to Debugging Features
	Introduction to Functions
	Provide Links to other XBasic sites, including link to documentation at xbwlteam/xb-manual
	Allow general user to create account to open problem chat
	User Registration
	Allow admin user to modify helpfile entries
	Allow admin supervisors (owners) to appoint admin staff as well as modify
		problem file entries
	Entry of user problems
	Entry of user responses

## Budgetary Constraints

	Because of the course-work associated with the module of which this project 
	is a part, we can allocate 6 man weeks to this project and this sets a limit
	on the work which can be done in practice.

	The project plan should be reviewed after 1 month of study, ie: About 5th Jan 2023

## Scope Calculations

	Project Component				Man Days
	Planning and Analysis				8
	Set-up of XB Doc Pages				1
	Favicon								0.5
	Logo 								0.5
	Menues								1
	Footer Links						0.5
	Introduction to Site				0.1
	XBasic General Description			0.2
	Introduction to PDE					1

	Introduction to Language Features	2
	Introduction to Functions			2
	Introduction to Debugging Features	2

	General User sign-in/registration   4.5

	Search Problems and Answers			2.2
	Submit Problem						2.5
	Submit Answers						2.5
	Edit Problems/Answers				2
	Totals								32.5

	The available time is 42 man days.
	We need the problems and answers sections to meet the CI requirements. So
	this and the associated user registration should be worked on first.

	if necessary we could suspend the Introduction to Language Features and 
	Introduction to Functions pages as these topics are covered in the linked 
	XBasic Manual. So this could be done last.

	Systems testing and reporting would be about 8 Man Days (1/4)

	Allowing one week for other matters the latest the project could begin is 60 man days
	before the CI deadline, that is March 15 2023.

	In practice it can begin earlier than this as the necessary course material is
	completed.
