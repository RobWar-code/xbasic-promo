## Project Aims

	To provide an introduction and support system for potential and
	existing users of the XBasic programming language.

	To meet the requirements of the CI Full Stack Development Diploma
	Project 4. See: project-requirements.txt

## Gathering Requirements and Solutions

	Although this document currently includes assumed requirements
	based on the author's experience, it would be beneficial to
	perform an Agile UCD type of approach to provide an additional/
	alternative set.

	To this end a survey has been sent to the XBasic User's group 
	to gather information on additional requirements.

	The ideation session could conceivably be carried-out with
	members of this group or possibly on slack to get a slightly
	wider perspective.

## Course Tool Requirements

	Project Management and recording should be set-up and
	followed in Agile-type style (staging) on GitHub Issues/Projects
	with requirements/user stories drawn from initial analysis 
	in this document.

	Wireframe layouts will be hand-drawn roughs scanned in as
	.jpg for reference.

	The initial page layouts should be done with HTML Bootstrap 4.6



## Users and Requirements

	It is anticpated that the site would be visited by the following
	types of user:

		People with Windows or Linux systems that are new to 
		programming who are looking for a programming
		language that is fully-featured but easy to learn.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a rapid development
		system for interactive and command-line utilities that can 
		run on Linux and Windows with easy debugging features.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a straight-forward
		way to build standalone GUI applications for Linux and/or
		Windows.

		Existing XBasic users who need additional look-up facilities
		and a forum for discussing problems and reporting errors.

		Some users may be using a mobile phone or tablet to quickly
		reference programming languages

	Introduction to Language Features
	Introduction to Built-in Functions
	Introduction to Debugging Features
	Provide Links to other XBasic sites, including link to documentation at xbwlteam/xb-manual

## Budgetary Constraints

	Because of the course-work associated with the module of which this project 
	is a part, we can allocate 6 man weeks to this project and this sets a limit
	on the work which can be done in practice.

	The project plan should be reviewed after 1 month of study, ie: About 5th Jan 2023

## Feasibility and Initial Design Layouts

	See also: Design Layouts in doc/wireframes (rendered in INKSCAPE svg format)

	Since the primary aim is publicise XBasic, the initial design layout should
	be for the title-bar, menu, site introduction and general introduction to PDE
	which items appear on the main page.

	Of primary importance is to see whether the XBasic PDE image is satisfactory for
	mobiles. see: test-code/test-mobile-image-01.html. Initial trial seems reasonably
	satisfactory.

	Check-out the use of iframes - can they use nested code or do they have to use
	separate web pages? Instead Iframes use scrollable divs, this can be established
	by setting the style properties overflow-y: auto and overflow-x: auto. This allows
	the scrollable area to contain the page code.

	Check-out text areas - can the entered text exceed the size of the visible area?
	A scroll bar appears when the text is longer than the displayed area height.
	Use styles white-space: nowrap and white-space: pre to obtain wrap-free text with
	a horizontal scrollbar. This would be better for code listings.

## Initial Scope Calculations/Feasibility

	Project Component				Man Days	Priority
	Planning and Analysis				8			1
	Set-up of XB Doc Pages				1			2
	Favicon								0.5			2
	Logo 								0.5			1
	Menues								1			1
	Footer Links						0.5			2
	Introduction to Site				0.1			1
	XBasic General Description			0.2			1
	Introduction to PDE					1			3

	Introduction to Language Features	2			3
	Introduction to Functions			2			4
	Introduction to Debugging Features	2			3

	General User sign-in/registration   4.5			1

	Search Problems and Answers			2.2			1
	Submit Problem						2.5			1
	Submit Answers						2.5			1
	Edit Problems/Answers				2			2
	Totals								32.5

	The available time is 42 man days.
	We need the problems and answers sections to meet the CI requirements. So
	this and the associated user registration should be worked on first.

	if necessary we could suspend the Introduction to Language Features and 
	Introduction to Functions pages as these topics are covered in the linked 
	XBasic Manual. So this could be done last.

	Systems testing and reporting would be about 8 Man Days (1/4)

	Allowing one week for other matters the latest the project could begin is 60 man days
	before the CI deadline, that is March 15 2023.

	In practice it can begin earlier than this as the necessary course material is
	completed.
