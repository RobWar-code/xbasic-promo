## Project Aims

	To provide an introduction and support system for potential and
	existing users of the XBasic programming language.

	To meet the requirements of the CI Full Stack Development Diploma
	Project 4. See: project-requirements.txt

## Gathering Requirements and Solutions

	Although this document currently includes assumed requirements
	based on the author's experience, it would be beneficial to
	perform an Agile UCD type of approach to provide an additional/
	alternative set.

	To this end a survey has been sent to the XBasic User's group 
	to gather information on additional requirements.

	The ideation session could conceivably be carried-out with
	members of this group or possibly on slack to get a slightly
	wider perspective.

## Users and Requirements

	It is anticpated that the site would be visited by the following
	types of user:

		People with Windows or Linux systems that are new to 
		programming who are looking for a programming
		language that is fully-featured but easy to learn.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a rapid development
		system for interactive and command-line utilities that can 
		run on Linux and Windows with easy debugging features.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a straight-forward
		way to build standalone GUI applications for Linux and/or
		Windows.

		Existing XBasic users who need additional look-up facilities
		and a forum for discussing problems and reporting errors.

		Some users may be using a mobile phone or tablet to quickly
		reference programming languages

### User Stories and Requirements

	The envisioned user roles are:
		User
			New Programmer

	As an existing programmer I can refer to a description of the GUI toolkit in order to determine
	whether XBasic is suitable for my requirements

		Acceptance Criteria

			GUI toolkit description and screenshots on own page

	Mobile Phone User:
		As a mobile phone user I can read the material supported by screenshots in order to compensate for
		small screenshots

	
		Acceptance Criteria

	Epic:
	As a user I can discuss XBasic Issues with others in order to fix my code or learn how to do something

		Error and problem discussion page/Database

	Epic:
	As a new user I can register myself in order to be known to the XBasic community

	As a new user I can register my email address in order to receive XBasic mailings

		Acceptance Criteria

			Registration allows for valid email address

			Email address is confirmed as valid by use of a link from an email

	As a new user I can register a unique username in order to be known to other users and to recognise my own texts

		Acceptance Criteria

			Username is checked for conformity to standard alphanumeric

			Username is checked as unique

	

			Registration allows for password

	As a user I can register myself in order to refer back to previous issues



	



### Summary of Features to meet Requirements

	General Description
	Introduction to PDE
	Introduction to GUI toolkit
	Introduction to Language Features
	Introduction to Debugging Features
	Introduction to Functions
	Provide Links to other XBasic sites, including link to documentation at xbwlteam/xb-manual
	Allow general user to create account to open problem chat
	User Registration
	Allow admin user to modify helpfile entries
	Allow admin supervisors (owners) to appoint admin staff as well as modify
		problem file entries
	Entry of user problems
	Entry of user responses

## Budgetary Constraints

	Because of the course-work associated with the module of which this project 
	is a part, we can allocate 6 man weeks to this project and this sets a limit
	on the work which can be done in practice.

	The project plan should be reviewed after 1 month of study, ie: About 5th Jan 2023

## Scope Calculations

	Project Component				Man Days
	Planning and Analysis				8
	Set-up of XB Doc Pages				1
	Favicon								0.5
	Logo 								0.5
	Menues								1
	Footer Links						0.5
	Introduction to Site				0.1
	XBasic General Description			0.2
	Introduction to PDE					1

	Introduction to Language Features	2
	Introduction to Functions			2
	Introduction to Debugging Features	2

	General User sign-in/registration   4.5

	Search Problems and Answers			2.2
	Submit Problem						2.5
	Submit Answers						2.5
	Edit Problems/Answers				2
	Totals								32.5

	The available time is 42 man days.
	We need the problems and answers sections to meet the CI requirements. So
	this and the associated user registration should be worked on first.

	if necessary we could suspend the Introduction to Language Features and 
	Introduction to Functions pages as these topics are covered in the linked 
	XBasic Manual. So this could be done last.

	Systems testing and reporting would be about 8 Man Days (1/4)

	Allowing one week for other matters the latest the project could begin is 60 man days
	before the CI deadline, that is March 15 2023.

	In practice it can begin earlier than this as the necessary course material is
	completed.
