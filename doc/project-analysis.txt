## Project Aims

	To provide an introduction and support system for potential and
	existing users of the XBasic programming language.

	To meet the requirements of the CI Full Stack Development Diploma
	Project 4. See: project-requirements.txt

## Users and Requirements

	It is anticpated that the site would be visited by the following
	types of user:

		People with Windows or Linux systems that are new to 
		programming who are looking for a programming
		language that is fully-featured but easy to learn.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a rapid development
		system for interactive and command-line utilities that can 
		run on Linux and Windows with easy debugging features.

		Existing programmers who are looking for a straight-forward
		way to build standalone GUI applications for Linux and/or
		Windows.

		Existing XBasic users who need additional look-up facilities
		and a forum for discussing problems and reporting errors.

		Some users may be using a mobile phone or tablet to quickly
		reference programming languages

### User Stories and Requirements

	New Programmers:
	"I need to know how easy it is to learn to use this system"

		The opening page should have a brief description of the XBasic
		system.

		There should be screenshots of the PDE, toolbox in operation

		A screenshot example of some code which has been run

		A screenshot example of an error message

	"I need documentation/training material"

		Link to the XBasic manual

	"I need some code examples"

		Reference to the code examples provided with the download

	"I need to know how to obtain and set-up this system"

		Links to the sourceforge and github sites

	"I need to talk to users"

		Links to the groups.io and sourceforge sites

	Utility Programmers:


## Budgetary Constraints

	Because of the course-work associated with the module of which this project 
	is a part, we can allocate 5 man weeks to this project and this sets a limit
	on the work which can be done in practice.

	The project plan should be reviewed after 1 month of study, ie: About 5th Jan 2023

## Desirable Features

	General Description
	Introduction to PDE
	Introduction to Language Features
	Introduction to Functions
	Provide Links to other XBasic sites, including link to documentation at narayana-art.co.uk
	Incorporate Helpfiles From XBasic
	Provide search helpfile features
	Allow general user to create account to open problem chat
	Allow admin user to modify helpfile entries
	Allow admin supervisors (owners) to appoint admin staff as well as modify
		helpfile entries
	Entry of user problems
	Entry of user responses

### Introduction to Site
	This appears on the main page one or two paragraphs of text

	0.2 Man Days

### General Description
	This appears on the main page, one or two paragraphs of text

	0.2 Man Days

### Introduction to PDE
	This appears on the main page, two or three paragraphs + picture

	0.5 Man Days

	Includes picture and description of the form design toolbox

	0.5 Man Days

### Introduction to Language Features
	This appears on a separate page with menu link

	3 Man Days

### Introduction to Functions
	This appears on a separate page with menu link

	2 Man Days

### General User Sign-In/Up
	This appears in a modal pop-up when the menu link or button is
	clicked. Gives the option to sign-up.

	The sign-in option detects whether the user is a site owner/site admin
	or general user.

	Frontend: 1 Man Days
	Backend : 0.5 Man Days

	New Registration
	Frontend: 1 Man Days
	Backend: 0.5 Man Days

	Allocate Admin Staff - available to Owners only
	Frontend: 1 Man Days
	Backend: 0.5 Man Days

### Incorporate Help Files from XBasic
	Data processing - 3 Man Days

### Administer Help Files
	3 Man Days

### Search Help Files
	This is a separate page accessible from the menu

	Frontend: 2 Man Days
	Backend: 2 Man Days

### Search Problems and Answers
	This is a separate page accessible from the menu

	Frontend: 4 Man Days
	Backend: 3 Man Days

### Submit Problem
	This is a separate page accessible from the menu

	Frontend: 4 Man Days

## Scope Calculations

	Project Component				Man Days
	Planning and Analysis				8
	Set-up of XB Doc Pages				1
	Menues								1
	Footer Links						0.5
	Introduction to Site				0.2
	XBasic General Description			0.2
	Introduction to PDE					1

	Introduction to Language Features	3
	Introduction to Functions			2

	General User sign-in/registration   5

	Incorporate Help Files				3
	Administer Help Files				3
	Search Help Files					4

	Search Problems and Answers			7
	Submit Problem						6
	Submit Answers						9
	Edit Problems/Answers				5
	Totals								59

	For the moment this exceeds the available time 35 Man Days.
	We need the problems and answers sections to meet the CI requirements.
	If we delay the introduction of the helpfiles, we have 49 Man Days.

	We could suspend the Introduction to Language Features and Introduction to Functions
	pages as these topics are covered in the linked XBasic Manual.
	This leaves 39 Man Days


	Systems testing and reporting would be about 14 days (1/4)

	Allowing one week for other matters the latest the project could begin is 60 man days
	before the CI deadline, that is March 15 2023.

	In practice it can begin earlier than this as the necessary course material is
	completed.
