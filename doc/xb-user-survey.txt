The following is the text of the survey to be sent to XBasic users
to gather information on their relationship with the programming
language and PDE.

Dear XBasic Users

Hope you all had good Christmas and are looking forward to the
new year.

I am in the process of launching a new XBasic website to help 
to publicise the language.

Please can you spare a few moments to reply to the following
survey, please do not feel constrained in your replies:

1. Roughly speaking why did you want to write computer programs in the first instance?

2. What reasons did you have for choosing XBasic?

3. What reasons do you think there are for recommending XBasic now?

Regards
Robin Warner
