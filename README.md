# xbasic-promo

## Introduction

This site provides the source and documentation for a website that
provides an introduction to the programming language and Program 
Development Environment (PDE) XBasic and an issue/problem reporting
reporting page for additional user support.

## Target Audience

The website is intended for programmers, both novice and established
to allow them access to the information required to make a decision
on choosing the XBasic programming language.

Additionally, the site provides for existing users to discuss issues
arising from their work.

## Development Methodology
Following from the UXD approach to design, the requirements are
established as a set of user stories and maintained as a list
in the Github issues set-up for project management.

Although the development approach is basically a Waterfall approach, 
it borrows from the Agile approach, in terms of completing iterations
(milestones) of work in order of priority, so that the project has 
flexible scope rather than trying to skip the deadlines for a completed 
work.

The initial analysis has been conducted in [Project Analysis](/doc/project-analysis.txt).
High-level time recording and estimating is also maintained in this file.
